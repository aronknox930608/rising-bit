## Development Guideline

* Number one priority is UX for the end-user, to make it a pleasant experience to work with this tool!
* Code should be kept simple: easy to understand, easy to collaborate/contribute (as much as possible of course).


## Tests

* Work with multiple projects, in separate folders
