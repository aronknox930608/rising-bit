Bitrise (offline) CLI

You can run your Bitrise workflow with this CLI tool,
on your own device.

Part of the Bitrise Continuous Integration, Delivery and Automations Stack.


## Install and Setup

Check the latest release for instructions at: [https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/releases](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/releases)


## Tutorials and Examples

You can find examples in the [_examples](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/tree/master/_examples) folder.

If you're getting started you should start with [_examples/tutorials](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/tree/master/_examples/tutorials),
this should guide you through the basics, while you'll already use `bitrise` (requires installed `bitrise`).

## Development Guideline

* Number one priority is UX for the end-user, to make it a pleasant experience to work with this tool!
* Code should be kept simple: easy to understand, easy to collaborate/contribute (as much as possible of course).
