          To prevent step testing issues, like referencing relative
          files with just './some-file', which would work for local tests
          but not if the step is included in another bitrise.yml!
        inputs:
        - content: |-
            #!/bin/bash
            set -e

          The example input has a default value,
          you can overwrite it if you want to, just like we did below,
          but the step would use the default value specified in the `step.yml`
          file if you would not specify another value.
        inputs:
        - example_step_input: Example Step Input's value
