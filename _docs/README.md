# Welcome to the Bitrise (offline) CLI Documentation section

## Documentation overview

* We recommend starting with our [How to Guide](cli-how-to-guide.md), we know it's a bit long but it's worth the time.
* But if you are in a hurry and would just like to get a quick overview check out the [Introduction](cli-introduction.md)
* We also put together a special little documentation for those [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) fans to make it a bit more easier to get the Workflow for your project up and running on your own machine. You can check it out [here](cli-react-native.md).
* And of course we added a [Step Share Guide](cli-share-guide.md) so you can share your first Steps with us and the whole world! We are looking forward to your awesome StepLib Pull Requests!

Happy Building!
