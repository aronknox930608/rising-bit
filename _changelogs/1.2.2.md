## Changes

* __Fixed__ step log, at build failed mode (at step log footer section Issue tracker and Source row trimming fixed).
* __Fixed__ `bitrise validate` if called with `--format=json` : in case the validation failed it printed two JSON responses instead of just one. Fixed.


## Install or upgrade

To install this version, run the following commands (in a bash shell):

```
curl -fL https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/releases/download/1.2.2/bitrise-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > /usr/local/bin/bitrise
```

Then:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bitrise
```

That's all, you're ready to go!

Optionally, you can call `bitrise setup` to verify that everything what's required for `bitrise` to run
is installed and available, but if you forget to do this it'll be performed the first
time you call `bitrise run`.
