## Changes

* __FIX__ : If `$BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR` is defined in an environment with an empty value `bitrise` now skips the definition. Practically this means that if you have an empty `BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR` item in your Workflow or App Environment but you define a real value in your `.bitrise.secrets.yml` `bitrise` will now use the (real) value defined in `.bitrise.secrets.yml`, instead of going with the empty value defined in the Workflow environments.


## Install or upgrade

To install this version, run the following commands (in a bash shell):

```
curl -fL https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/releases/download/1.1.1/bitrise-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > /usr/local/bin/bitrise
```

Then:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bitrise
```

That's all, you're ready to go!

Optionally, you can call `bitrise setup` to verify that everything what's required for `bitrise` to run
is installed and available, but if you forget to do this it'll be performed the first
time you call `bitrise run`.
