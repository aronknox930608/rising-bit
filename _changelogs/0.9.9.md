## Changes

* `bitrise setup` revision : better `brew` checking (calls `brew update` and `brew doctor` too) but no direct Command Line Tools checking.
    * The previous solution was incompatible with OS X Mountain Lion and earlier versions, this version solves this incompatibility.

## Install or upgrade

To install this version, run the following commands (in a bash shell):

```
curl -L https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/releases/download/0.9.9/bitrise-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > /usr/local/bin/bitrise
```

Then:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bitrise
```

That's all, you're ready to go!

Optionally, you can call `bitrise setup` to verify that everything what's required for `bitrise` to run
is installed and available, but if you forget to do this it'll be performed the first
time you call `bitrise run`.
