## Changes

* __FIX__ : `trigger_map` handling in Pull Request mode: if the pattern does match an item which has `is_pull_request_allowed=false` it won't fail now, it'll just skip the item and the next one will be tried.
* __new command__ : `bitrise share`, to share your step through `bitrise` (this is just a wrapper around `stepman share`, does exactly the same, but hopefully it's a bit more convenient if you never used `stepman` directly before).
* __new flag__ : similar to the `--ci` flag the Pull Request mode can now be allowed by calling any command with `bitrise --pr [command]`.


## Install or upgrade

To install this version, run the following commands (in a bash shell):

```
curl -fL https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/releases/download/1.2.1/bitrise-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > /usr/local/bin/bitrise
```

Then:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bitrise
```

That's all, you're ready to go!

Optionally, you can call `bitrise setup` to verify that everything what's required for `bitrise` to run
is installed and available, but if you forget to do this it'll be performed the first
time you call `bitrise run`.
