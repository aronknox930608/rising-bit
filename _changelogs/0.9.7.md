## Changes

* __IMPORTANT__ : The project was renamed from `bitrise-cli` to just `bitrise`, which means that from now on you have to call your commands with `bitrise [command]`, instead of the previous, longer `bitrise-cli [command]`.
* Improved step dependency management with `brew`.
* Log improvements.


## Install or upgrade

To install this version, run the following commands (in a bash shell):

```
curl -L https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/releases/download/0.9.7/bitrise-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > /usr/local/bin/bitrise
```

Then:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bitrise
```

The first time it's mandatory to call the `setup` after the install,
and as a best practice you should run the setup every time you install a new version of `bitrise`.

Doing the setup is as easy as:

```
bitrise setup
```

Once the setup finishes you have everything in place to use `bitrise`.
