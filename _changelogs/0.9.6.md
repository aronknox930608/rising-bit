## Changes

* __BREAKING__ : `.bitrise.secrets.yml` 's syntax changed, to match the environments syntax used everywhere else. This means that instead of directly specifying `is_expand` at the same level as the key and value you should now move this into an `opts:` section, just like in every other `envs` list in `bitrise.yml`.
* __NEW__ : dependency management built into `bitrise.yml` syntax. Right now only `brew` is supported, on OS X, but this will be expanded.
* if a step or a version can't be found in the local cache from a step library `bitrise-cli` will now update the local cache before failing with "step not found"
* greatly improved logs, colored step sections and step run summaries. It starts to look decent and is much more helpful than the previous log outputs.
* updated `setup` - only the Xcode Command Line tools are required now, if no full Xcode found it'll print a warning message about it but you can still use `bitrise-cli`.
* quite a lot of minor bug fixes


## Install or upgrade

To install this version, run the following commands (in a bash shell):

```
curl -L https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-cli/releases/download/0.9.6/bitrise-cli-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > /usr/local/bin/bitrise-cli
```

Then:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bitrise-cli
```

The first time it's mandatory to call the `setup` after the install,
and as a best practice you should run the setup every time you install a new version of `bitrise-cli`.

Doing the setup is as easy as:

```
bitrise-cli setup
```

Once the setup finishes you have everything in place to use `bitrise-cli`.
