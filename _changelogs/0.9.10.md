## Changes

* Improved `setup` : it has a new `--minimal` flag to skip more advanced setup checks, like the `brew doctor` call.
* Removed `brew update` completely from the `setup`.
* Step dependencies: before installing a dependency with `brew` bitrise now specifically asks for permission to do so, except in `--ci` mode.


## Install or upgrade

To install this version, run the following commands (in a bash shell):

```
curl -L https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/releases/download/0.9.10/bitrise-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > /usr/local/bin/bitrise
```

Then:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bitrise
```

That's all, you're ready to go!

Optionally, you can call `bitrise setup` to verify that everything what's required for `bitrise` to run
is installed and available, but if you forget to do this it'll be performed the first
time you call `bitrise run`.
